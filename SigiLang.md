# Sigi language reference

Sigi is a statically typed concatenative language derived from [Kitten](https://kittenlang.org/).
The language features type inference and first-class function values.

## Syntax

### Lexical analysis

Sigi tokens are the following:
- identifiers: `[a-zA-Z]\w*`, eg `a1`, `a_2`
- type variables: `'[a-z][a-z0-9]*`, eg `'a`, `'var0`
- row variables: `'[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*`, eg `'S`, `'R0`
- operators: 
  - binary:
    - arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
    - comparison:  `=`, `<>`, `<=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`
  - unary:
    - arithmetic: `+`, `-`
    - bitwise: `~` (bitwise NOT on integer)
    - boolean: `!` (boolean NOT)
- literals:
  - numbers (decimal only): `0|[1-9][0-9]*`
  - booleans: `true`, `false`
  - strings: double quoted, like `"abc"`, `""`. Supported escapes are `\n`, `\r`, `\"`, `\\`.
- keywords: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `func`
- separator: `;;`, and usual punctuation

Comments are end-of-line and start with `#`

### Expressions

Sigi is an expression language. The core language has the following expressions:
```ebnf
expr := literal                 // function that pushes a literal value
      | expr expr               // function composition
      | id | "(" op ")"         // function reference
      | "{" expr "}"            // quotation, ie push a closure
      | "->" id ("," id)* ";"   // pop values and give them names
```
The language has richer syntax for convenience, all of which reduces to the above expression forms.
Each expression is a function from a stack to another stack (or equivalently it performs side effects on an implicit stack).
Expressions have a static type that describes these effects.
Typing and evaluation rules are described in the semantics section below.

Additional expression forms:
- Writing `\id` or `\op` is shorthand for quotation. Eg `\double` is the same as `{ double }`, `\+` is the same as `{ (+) }`
- Arithmetic expressions are supported with the usual precedence rules. They map to function application, eg
  - `1 + 2` is the same as `1 2 (+)`
  - `1 + 2 * 3` is the same as `1 2 3 (*) (+)`
- if/elif/else are used to build conditionals. For instance `if (a) b else c` is mapped to `a { b } { c } cond apply`, where `cond` and `apply` are [language builtins](#builtins).

Outside of expressions, is also possible to declare a function with the syntax `"let" id ":" stackTy "=" expr ";;"`.
For instance this is the definition of a function that squares its argument:
```
# this is a new function named "square"
let square: int -> int = dup (*);;
```


## Semantics

### Type system

Sigi is a stack-based language. Function types describe how the stack changes when the function is called.

#### Data types

Data types are the types of runtime values, ie, values that can be placed on the stack. The following grammar shows how data types can be written in source:
```ebnf
(* the type of a value on the stack *)
dty      ::= typector
           | "(" funty ")" 
           | tvar (* a type variable, eg 'a, 'b *)
        
(* a type constructor, written in postfix syntax, eg `int list` *)
typector ::= dty* id
(* a function type. Pops the left list from stack and pushes the right list. *)
funty    ::= stacklist? "->" stacklist? 
stacklist::= (dty | rowvar) ("," (dty | rowvar))*
```

Types can be generic, as can be seen in the `typector` production. Type variables are written like `'a` or `'b`, Ã  la [[OCaml]].

#### Stack types

A stack type is written $c_1, \ldots, c_n \to p_1, \ldots, p_m$.  This is the type of a function that pops $n$ arguments from the stack and pushes $m$ results.The $c_i$ and $p_j$ are [[#data types|data types]].

Arguments are popped right-to-left and results are pushed left-to-right (i.e., the top of the stack is always on the right).
This convention allows easily seeing how the stack changes when the function is evaluated: here, the $c_1, \ldots, c_n$ (with $c_n$ the top) will be replaced by $p_1, \ldots, p_m$ (with $p_m$ the top).

All terms of the language have a stack type, for instance, the expression `1` has type `-> int`, because the effect of its evaluation is pushing the number 1 on the stack.

### Typing and evaluation

- `id` resolves a name in the enclosing scope. Names resolve to a *value*, a value having a data type, not a stack type. 
  - If `id` refers to a function of type $\mathbf{c}\to\mathbf{p}$, then the expression has that function type. 
  - If `id` refers to another kind of value of type $t$, then the expression has type $\to t$. 
  - If `id` does not refer to a name in scope, the expression is not well-typed.
- `{ e }` creates a function value whose expansion is the term `e` and pushes it on the stack. If $\mathtt{e}: t$, then $\mathtt{\{\,e\,\}} :\, \to t$.
- `-> x1,...,xn;` pops the $n$ values on top of the stack and binds them to names in the enclosing scope. The top of the stack is named $x_n$, the next value is named $x_{n-1}$, etc. The type of this expression is $'a_1, \ldots, 'a_n \to$, where the $'a_i$ are fresh type variables.
- `e1 e2` evaluates `e1`, then evaluates `e2`. In more abstract terms, this denotes the *composition* of both stack functions.

#### Typing the composition rule
 
Intuitively, in the term `e1 e2`, the composition rule drives type inference by unifying the outputs of `e1` with the inputs of `e2`.
For instance, let `e1: str -> int` and `e2: 'a -> str`.
For the term to be well-formed, the outputs of `e1` (`int`) must be compatible with the inputs of `e2` (`'a`). It must then hold that `'a = int`, hence we have inferred the type variable `'a`.
Since the intermediate `int` produced by `e1` is immediately consumed by `e2`, it does not appear in the type of the composition `e1 e2: str -> str`.

Let us define a *substitution* as a function from type variables to data types or type variables.
Assume $e_1: a_1,\ldots,a_n \to b_1,\ldots,b_m$ and $e_2: c_1,\ldots,c_t \to d_1,\ldots,d_s$. Let $q = \min (m,t)$. 
Assume that all the $a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$ are either data types or type variables, but not row variables (see [below](#row-polymorphic-types)). 
Then $e_1\ e_2$ is well-typed if there exists a substitution $\theta$ such that for all $k$, $0 \leq k < q$, we have $\theta\mathbf{c}_{t-k} = \theta\mathbf{b}_{m-k}$. If that is so, then the type of the term is given by $$e_1\ e_2 : \theta\mathbf{a}, \theta(\mathbf{c}_i)_{i < {t-q}} \to \theta(\mathbf{b}_j)_{{m-q}\leq j}, \theta\mathbf{d}.$$

This rule allows "spilling" of arguments that are not relevant to the composition rule, for instance, if `e1: 'a -> 'a, int` and `e2: -> str`, `e1 e2` is still well-typed, even though `e2` does not consume the results of `e1`. The composed type is `'a -> 'a, int, str`.

#### Scoping and the composition rule

If `e1 e2` is well-typed as described above, then all names introduced by `e1` are in scope in `e2`, and all names introduced by `e1` and `e2` are introduced by `e1 e2` in the enclosing scope.
The types of these names are substituted with $\theta$ in the enclosing scope.

This means that names are in scope in every term that follows them.
The use of the substitution gives more specific types to the bindings.
For instance, in a vacuum, `1` has type `-> int` and `-> x;` has type `'a ->`. In the expression `1 -> x;`, the type inference engine unifies `'a` with `int`, so that the binding `x` has type `int` in the following expressions.

#### Row polymorphic types

Note that the typing of the composition rule as described here ignores *row variables* for conciseness. Row polymorphism allows typing higher order functions and provides greater flexibility to the type system. It boils down to the idea that stack types may contain row variables, which can unify with an entire list of data types. For example, the higher-order builtin `apply` has type
```
apply: 'S, ('S -> 'R) -> 'R
```
where `'S` and `'R` are row variables. Given the term `(\+) apply` for instance, we will infer a row variable substitution `'S := int, int`, `'R := int` , so that the ground type of `apply` is `int, int, (int, int -> int) -> int`. The type of `(\+) apply` is therefore `int, int -> int` (in fact the type of `\f apply` is always the type of `f`).

Note that a function type $(c)_n \rightarrow (p)_m$, where no $c_i$ or $p_i$ is a row variable, is canonicalised to ${'}S, (c)_n \rightarrow {'}S, (p)_m$.
The introduced row variable represents "the rest of the stack", which in a trivial function type like this is just preserved.

## Builtins

Builtin type constructors:
- `bool`, a 1-bit integer
- `int`, a signed 32-bit integer

Builtin functions, apart from operators:
```
# Discard the top of the stack
pop: 'a ->
# Duplicate the top of the stack
pop: 'a -> 'a, 'a
# Swap the two values at the top of the stack
swap: 'a, 'b -> 'b, 'a
# Select a value using a boolean
cond: bool, 'a, 'a -> 'a
# Invoke a function value that is at the top of the stack
apply: 'S, ('S -> 'R) -> 'R
# Quote the value on top of the stack
quote: 'a -> (-> 'a)
# Pop the top of the stack and print it with a newline
show: 'a ->
# Print the top of the stack without popping it
pp: 'a -> 'a
```


## WIP

The following are built-in type constructors that are not fully supported by the language:
- `str`, a string type
- `'a list`, a list type

Both of those have expression forms to create them (eg `"abc"`, `[1, 2]`), and can participate in type inference properly.
However, they are only supported by the REPL and not by the MLIR emitter.
They also lack functions to manipulate them and do something useful with them.
